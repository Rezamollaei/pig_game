This JavaScript code implements a two-player dice game:

Initialization: Resets the scores, current score, and sets the first player as active.
Roll Dice: Generates a random dice roll, adds to the current score, and switches players if the roll is 1.
Hold Score: Adds the current score to the player's total. If a player reaches 20 points, they win.
New Game: Resets the game.
It tracks player states and dynamically updates the UI for scores, dice rolls, and player status.
